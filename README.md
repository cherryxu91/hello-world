# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I have been pondering on being a frontend developer or a data analyst for a while and thought why not try to learn both to see which path I'd enjoy more. I dabbled in Python last year and learned some HTML as well. 

I'm excited to learn more about what's out there and this repository was built to learn how to use Github. I will also add ideas and resources for learning here too using Git!
